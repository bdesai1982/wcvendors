# Codeception Test Suite Configuration
#
# Suite for acceptance tests.
# Perform tests in browser using the WPWebDriver or WPBrowser.
# Use WPDb to set up your initial database fixture.
# If you need both WPWebDriver and WPBrowser tests - create a separate suite.
# With capabilities commented out we are launching the chrome browser to test, which is more time consuming then headless mode.
